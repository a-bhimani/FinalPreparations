You are given a string, s, and a list of words, words, that are all of the same length. Find all starting indices of substring(s) in s that is a concatenation of each word in words exactly once and without any intervening characters.
For example, given: s: "barfoothefoobarman" words: ["foo", "bar"]
You should return the indices: [0,9]. (order does not matter).
For example, given: s: "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword" words: ["word", "good", "best", "good"]
You should return the indices: [8].

("aaa", new String[]{"aa", "aa"});
("lingmindraboofooowingdingbarrwingmonkeypoundcake", new String[]{"fooo", "barr", "wing", "ding", "wing"});
